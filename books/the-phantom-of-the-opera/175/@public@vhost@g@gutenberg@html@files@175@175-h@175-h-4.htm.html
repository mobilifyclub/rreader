<body><p>"It's incredible!"</p>
<p>"And, a little later, when M. de La Borderie went up to M. Richard, didn't you see M. Moncharmin fling himself between them and hear him exclaim, 'M. l'Ambassadeur I entreat you not to touch M. le Directeur'?"</p>
<p>"It's terrible! ... And what was Richard doing meanwhile?"</p>
<p>"What was he doing? Why, you saw him! He turned about, BOWED IN FRONT OF HIM, THOUGH THERE WAS NOBODY IN FRONT OF HIM, AND WITHDREW BACKWARD."</p>
<p>"BACKWARD?"</p>
<p>"And Moncharmin, behind Richard, also turned about; that is, he described a semicircle behind Richard and also WALKED BACKWARD! ... And they went LIKE THAT to the staircase leading to the managers' office: BACKWARD, BACKWARD, BACKWARD! ... Well, if they are not mad, will you explain what it means?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps they were practising a figure in the ballet," suggested Gabriel, without much conviction in his voice.</p>
<p>The secretary was furious at this wretched joke, made at so dramatic a moment. He knit his brows and contracted his lips. Then he put his mouth to Gabriel's ear:</p>
<p>"Don't be so sly, Gabriel. There are things going on for which you and Mercier are partly responsible."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" asked Gabriel.</p>
<p>"Christine Daae is not the only one who suddenly disappeared to-night."</p>
<p>"Oh, nonsense!"</p>
<p>"There's no nonsense about it. Perhaps you can tell me why, when Mother Giry came down to the foyer just now, Mercier took her by the hand and hurried her away with him?"</p>
<p>"Really?" said Gabriel, "I never saw it."</p>
<p>"You did see it, Gabriel, for you went with Mercier and Mother Giry to Mercier's office. Since then, you and Mercier have been seen, but no one has seen Mother Giry."</p>
<p>"Do you think we've eaten her?"</p>
<p>"No, but you've locked her up in the office; and any one passing the office can hear her yelling, 'Oh, the scoundrels! Oh, the scoundrels!'"</p>
<p>At this point of this singular conversation, Mercier arrived, all out of breath.</p>
<p>"There!" he said, in a gloomy voice. "It's worse than ever! ... I shouted, 'It's a serious matter! Open the door! It's I, Mercier.' I heard footsteps. The door opened and Moncharmin appeared. He was very pale. He said, 'What do you want?' I answered, 'Some one has run away with Christine Daae.' What do you think he said? 'And a good job, too!' And he shut the door, after putting this in my hand."</p>
<p>Mercier opened his hand; Remy and Gabriel looked.</p>
<p>"The safety-pin!" cried Remy.</p>
<p>"Strange! Strange!" muttered Gabriel, who could not help shivering.</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice made them all three turn round.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen. Could you tell me where Christine Daae is?"</p>
<p>In spite of the seriousness of the circumstances, the absurdity of the question would have made them roar with laughter, if they had not caught sight of a face so sorrow-stricken that they were at once seized with pity. It was the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny.</p>

<h3 class="c2" id="pgepubid00021">Chapter XV Christine! Christine!</h3>
<p>Raoul's first thought, after Christine Daae's fantastic disappearance, was to accuse Erik. He no longer doubted the almost supernatural powers of the Angel of Music, in this domain of the Opera in which he had set up his empire. And Raoul rushed on the stage, in a mad fit of love and despair.</p>
<p>"Christine! Christine!" he moaned, calling to her as he felt that she must be calling to him from the depths of that dark pit to which the monster had carried her. "Christine! Christine!"</p>
<p>And he seemed to hear the girl's screams through the frail boards that separated him from her. He bent forward, he listened, ... he wandered over the stage like a madman. Ah, to descend, to descend into that pit of darkness every entrance to which was closed to him, ... for the stairs that led below the stage were forbidden to one and all that night!</p>
<p>"Christine! Christine! ..."</p>
<p>People pushed him aside, laughing. They made fun of him. They thought the poor lover's brain was gone!</p>
<p>By what mad road, through what passages of mystery and darkness known to him alone had Erik dragged that pure-souled child to the awful haunt, with the Louis-Philippe room, opening out on the lake?</p>
<p>"Christine! Christine! ... Why don't you answer? ... Are you alive? ..."</p>
<p>Hideous thoughts flashed through Raoul's congested brain. Of course, Erik must have discovered their secret, must have known that Christine had played him false. What a vengeance would be his!</p>
<p>And Raoul thought again of the yellow stars that had come, the night before, and roamed over his balcony. Why had he not put them out for good? There were some men's eyes that dilated in the darkness and shone like stars or like cats' eyes. Certainly Albinos, who seemed to have rabbits' eyes by day, had cats' eyes at night: everybody knew that! ... Yes, yes, he had undoubtedly fired at Erik. Why had he not killed him? The monster had fled up the gutter-spout like a cat or a convict who—everybody knew that also—would scale the very skies, with the help of a gutter-spout ... No doubt Erik was at that time contemplating some decisive step against Raoul, but he had been wounded and had escaped to turn against poor Christine instead.</p>
<p>Such were the cruel thoughts that haunted Raoul as he ran to the singer's dressing-room.</p>
<p>"Christine! Christine!"</p>
<p>Bitter tears scorched the boy's eyelids as he saw scattered over the furniture the clothes which his beautiful bride was to have worn at the hour of their flight. Oh, why had she refused to leave earlier?</p>
<p>Why had she toyed with the threatening catastrophe? Why toyed with the monster's heart? Why, in a final access of pity, had she insisted on flinging, as a last sop to that demon's soul, her divine song:</p>
<p class="noindent">"Holy angel, in Heaven blessed,<br/>
My spirit longs with thee to rest!"<br/></p>
<p>Raoul, his throat filled with sobs, oaths and insults, fumbled awkwardly at the great mirror that had opened one night, before his eyes, to let Christine pass to the murky dwelling below. He pushed, pressed, groped about, but the glass apparently obeyed no one but Erik ... Perhaps actions were not enough with a glass of the kind? Perhaps he was expected to utter certain words? When he was a little boy, he had heard that there were things that obeyed the spoken word!</p>
<p>Suddenly, Raoul remembered something about a gate opening into the Rue Scribe, an underground passage running straight to the Rue Scribe from the lake ... Yes, Christine had told him about that... And, when he found that the key was no longer in the box, he nevertheless ran to the Rue Scribe. Outside, in the street, he passed his trembling hands over the huge stones, felt for outlets ... met with iron bars ... were those they? ... Or these? ... Or could it be that air-hole? ... He plunged his useless eyes through the bars ... How dark it was in there! ... He listened ... All was silence! ... He went round the building ... and came to bigger bars, immense gates! ... It was the entrance to the Cour de l'Administration.</p>
<p>Raoul rushed into the doorkeeper's lodge.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, madame, could you tell me where to find a gate or door, made of bars, iron bars, opening into the Rue Scribe ... and leading to the lake? ... You know the lake I mean? ... Yes, the underground lake ... under the Opera."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, I know there is a lake under the Opera, but I don't know which door leads to it. I have never been there!"</p>
<p>"And the Rue Scribe, madame, the Rue Scribe? Have you never been to the Rue Scribe?"</p>
<p>The woman laughed, screamed with laughter! Raoul darted away, roaring with anger, ran up-stairs, four stairs at a time, down-stairs, rushed through the whole of the business side of the opera-house, found himself once more in the light of the stage.</p>
<p>He stopped, with his heart thumping in his chest: suppose Christine Daae had been found? He saw a group of men and asked:</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen. Could you tell me where Christine Daae is?"</p>
<p>And somebody laughed.</p>
<p>At the same moment the stage buzzed with a new sound and, amid a crowd of men in evening-dress, all talking and gesticulating together, appeared a man who seemed very calm and displayed a pleasant face, all pink and chubby-cheeked, crowned with curly hair and lit up by a pair of wonderfully serene blue eyes. Mercier, the acting-manager, called the Vicomte de Chagny's attention to him and said:</p>
<p>"This is the gentleman to whom you should put your question, monsieur. Let me introduce Mifroid, the commissary of police."</p>
<p>"Ah, M. le Vicomte de Chagny! Delighted to meet you, monsieur," said the commissary. "Would you mind coming with me? ... And now where are the managers? ... Where are the managers?"</p>
<p>Mercier did not answer, and Remy, the secretary, volunteered the information that the managers were locked up in their office and that they knew nothing as yet of what had happened.</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say so! Let us go up to the office!"</p>
<p>And M. Mifroid, followed by an ever-increasing crowd, turned toward the business side of the building. Mercier took advantage of the confusion to slip a key into Gabriel's hand:</p>
<p>"This is all going very badly," he whispered. "You had better let Mother Giry out."</p>
<p>And Gabriel moved away.</p>
<p>They soon came to the managers' door. Mercier stormed in vain: the door remained closed.</p>
<p>"Open in the name of the law!" commanded M. Mifroid, in a loud and rather anxious voice.</p>
<p>At last the door was opened. All rushed in to the office, on the commissary's heels.</p>
<p>Raoul was the last to enter. As he was about to follow the rest into the room, a hand was laid on his shoulder and he heard these words spoken in his ear:</p>
<p>"ERIK'S SECRETS CONCERN NO ONE BUT HIMSELF!"</p>
<p>He turned around, with a stifled exclamation. The hand that was laid on his shoulder was now placed on the lips of a person with an ebony skin, with eyes of jade and with an astrakhan cap on his head: the Persian! The stranger kept up the gesture that recommended discretion and then, at the moment when the astonished viscount was about to ask the reason of his mysterious intervention, bowed and disappeared.</p>

<h3 class="c2" id="pgepubid00022">Chapter XVI Mme. Giry's Astounding Revelations<br/>
as to Her Personal Relations with the Opera Ghost</h3>
<p>Before following the commissary into the manager's office I must describe certain extraordinary occurrences that took place in that office which Remy and Mercier had vainly tried to enter and into which MM. Richard and Moncharmin had locked themselves with an object which the reader does not yet know, but which it is my duty, as an historian, to reveal without further postponement.</p>
<p>I have had occasion to say that the managers' mood had undergone a disagreeable change for some time past and to convey the fact that this change was due not only to the fall of the chandelier on the famous night of the gala performance.</p>
<p>The reader must know that the ghost had calmly been paid his first twenty thousand francs. Oh, there had been wailing and gnashing of teeth, indeed! And yet the thing had happened as simply as could be.</p>
<p>One morning, the managers found on their table an envelope addressed to "Monsieur O. G. (private)" and accompanied by a note from O. G. himself:</p>
<p>The time has come to carry out the clause in the memorandum-book. Please put twenty notes of a thousand francs each into this envelope, seal it with your own seal and hand it to Mme. Giry, who will do what is necessary.</p>
<p>The managers did not hesitate; without wasting time in asking how these confounded communications came to be delivered in an office which they were careful to keep locked, they seized this opportunity of laying hands, on the mysterious blackmailer. And, after telling the whole story, under the promise of secrecy, to Gabriel and Mercier, they put the twenty thousand francs into the envelope and without asking for explanations, handed it to Mme. Giry, who had been reinstated in her functions. The box-keeper displayed no astonishment. I need hardly say that she was well watched. She went straight to the ghost's box and placed the precious envelope on the little shelf attached to the ledge. The two managers, as well as Gabriel and Mercier, were hidden in such a way that they did not lose sight of the envelope for a second during the performance and even afterward, for, as the envelope had not moved, those who watched it did not move either; and Mme. Giry went away while the managers, Gabriel and Mercier were still there. At last, they became tired of waiting and opened the envelope, after ascertaining that the seals had not been broken.</p>
<p>At first sight, Richard and Moncharmin thought that the notes were still there; but soon they perceived that they were not the same. The twenty real notes were gone and had been replaced by twenty notes, of the "Bank of St. Farce"![1]</p>
<p>The managers' rage and fright were unmistakable. Moncharmin wanted to send for the commissary of police, but Richard objected. He no doubt had a plan, for he said:</p>
<p>"Don't let us make ourselves ridiculous! All Paris would laugh at us. O. G. has won the first game: we will win the second."</p>
<p>He was thinking of the next month's allowance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they had been so absolutely tricked that they were bound to suffer a certain dejection. And, upon my word, it was not difficult to understand. We must not forget that the managers had an idea at the back of their minds, all the time, that this strange incident might be an unpleasant practical joke on the part of their predecessors and that it would not do to divulge it prematurely. On the other hand, Moncharmin was sometimes troubled with a suspicion of Richard himself, who occasionally took fanciful whims into his head. And so they were content to await events, while keeping an eye on Mother Giry. Richard would not have her spoken to.</p>
<p>"If she is a confederate," he said, "the notes are gone long ago. But, in my opinion, she is merely an idiot."</p>
<p>"She's not the only idiot in this business," said Moncharmin pensively.</p>
<p>"Well, who could have thought it?" moaned Richard. "But don't be afraid ... next time, I shall have taken my precautions."</p>
<p>The next time fell on the same day that beheld the disappearance of Christine Daae. In the morning, a note from the ghost reminded them that the money was due. It read:</p>
<p>Do just as you did last time. It went very well. Put the twenty thousand in the envelope and hand it to our excellent Mme. Giry.</p>
<p>And the note was accompanied by the usual envelope. They had only to insert the notes.</p>
<p>This was done about half an hour before the curtain rose on the first act of Faust. Richard showed the envelope to Moncharmin. Then he counted the twenty thousand-franc notes in front of him and put the notes into the envelope, but without closing it.</p>
<p>"And now," he said, "let's have Mother Giry in."</p>
<p>The old woman was sent for. She entered with a sweeping courtesy. She still wore her black taffeta dress, the color of which was rapidly turning to rust and lilac, to say nothing of the dingy bonnet. She seemed in a good temper. She at once said:</p>
<p>"Good evening, gentlemen! It's for the envelope, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mme. Giry," said Richard, most amiably. "For the envelope ... and something else besides."</p>
<p>"At your service, M. Richard, at your service. And what is the something else, please?"</p>
<p>"First of all, Mme. Giry, I have a little question to put to you."</p>
<p>"By all means, M. Richard: Mme. Giry is here to answer you."</p>
<p>"Are you still on good terms with the ghost?"</p>
<p>"Couldn't be better, sir; couldn't be better."</p>
<p>"Ah, we are delighted ... Look here, Mme. Giry," said Richard, in the tone of making an important confidence. "We may just as well tell you, among ourselves ... you're no fool!"</p>
<p>"Why, sir," exclaimed the box-keeper, stopping the pleasant nodding of the black feathers in her dingy bonnet, "I assure you no one has ever doubted that!"</p>
<p>"We are quite agreed and we shall soon understand one another. The story of the ghost is all humbug, isn't it? ... Well, still between ourselves, ... it has lasted long enough."</p>
<p>Mme. Giry looked at the managers as though they were talking Chinese. She walked up to Richard's table and asked, rather anxiously:</p>
<p>"What do you mean? I don't understand."</p>
<p>"Oh, you, understand quite well. In any case, you've got to understand... And, first of all, tell us his name."</p>
<p>"Whose name?"</p>
<p>"The name of the man whose accomplice you are, Mme. Giry!"</p>
<p>"I am the ghost's accomplice? I? ... His accomplice in what, pray?"</p>
<p>"You do all he wants."</p>
<p>"Oh! He's not very troublesome, you know."</p>
<p>"And does he still tip you?"</p>
<p>"I mustn't complain."</p>
<p>"How much does he give you for bringing him that envelope?"</p>
<p>"Ten francs."</p>
<p>"You poor thing! That's not much, is it?</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you that presently, Mme. Giry. Just now we should like to know for what extraordinary reason you have given yourself body and soul, to this ghost ... Mme. Giry's friendship and devotion are not to be bought for five francs or ten francs."</p>
<p>"That's true enough ... And I can tell you the reason, sir. There's no disgrace about it... on the contrary."</p>
<p>"We're quite sure of that, Mme. Giry!"</p>
<p>"Well, it's like this ... only the ghost doesn't like me to talk about his business."</p>
<p>"Indeed?" sneered Richard.</p>
<p>"But this is a matter that concerns myself alone ... Well, it was in Box Five one evening, I found a letter addressed to myself, a sort of note written in red ink. I needn't read the letter to you sir; I know it by heart, and I shall never forget it if I live to be a hundred!"</p>
<p>And Mme. Giry, drawing herself up, recited the letter with touching eloquence:</p>
<p class="noindent">MADAM:</p>
<p>1825. Mlle. Menetrier, leader of the ballet, became Marquise de Cussy.</p>
<p>1832. Mlle. Marie Taglioni, a dancer, became Comtesse Gilbert des Voisins.</p>
<p>1846. La Sota, a dancer, married a brother of the King of Spain.</p>
<p>1847. Lola Montes, a dancer, became the morganatic wife of King Louis of Bavaria and was created Countess of Landsfeld.</p>
<p>1848. Mlle. Maria, a dancer, became Baronne d'Herneville.</p>
<p>1870. Theresa Hessier, a dancer, married Dom Fernando, brother to the King of Portugal.</p>
<p>Richard and Moncharmin listened to the old woman, who, as she proceeded with the enumeration of these glorious nuptials, swelled out, took courage and, at last, in a voice bursting with pride, flung out the last sentence of the prophetic letter:</p>
<p>1885. Meg Giry, Empress!</p>
<p>Exhausted by this supreme effort, the box-keeper fell into a chair, saying:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, the letter was signed, 'Opera Ghost.' I had heard much of the ghost, but only half believed in him. From the day when he declared that my little Meg, the flesh of my flesh, the fruit of my womb, would be empress, I believed in him altogether."</p>
<p>And really it was not necessary to make a long study of Mme. Giry's excited features to understand what could be got out of that fine intellect with the two words "ghost" and "empress."</p>
<p>But who pulled the strings of that extraordinary puppet? That was the question.</p>
<p>"You have never seen him; he speaks to you and you believe all he says?" asked Moncharmin.</p>
<p>"Yes. To begin with, I owe it to him that my little Meg was promoted to be the leader of a row. I said to the ghost, 'If she is to be empress in 1885, there is no time to lose; she must become a leader at once.' He said, 'Look upon it as done.' And he had only a word to say to M. Poligny and the thing was done."</p>
<p>"So you see that M. Poligny saw him!"</p>
<p>"No, not any more than I did; but he heard him. The ghost said a word in his ear, you know, on the evening when he left Box Five, looking so dreadfully pale."</p>
<p>Moncharmin heaved a sigh. "What a business!" he groaned.</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Mme. Giry. "I always thought there were secrets between the ghost and M. Poligny. Anything that the ghost asked M. Poligny to do M. Poligny did. M. Poligny could refuse the ghost nothing."</p>
<p>"You hear, Richard: Poligny could refuse the ghost nothing."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I hear!" said Richard. "M. Poligny is a friend of the ghost; and, as Mme. Giry is a friend of M. Poligny, there we are! ... But I don't care a hang about M. Poligny," he added roughly. "The only person whose fate really interests me is Mme. Giry... Mme. Giry, do you know what is in this envelope?"</p>
<p>"Why, of course not," she said.</p>
<p>"Well, look."</p>
<p>Mine. Giry looked into the envelope with a lackluster eye, which soon recovered its brilliancy.</p>
<p>"Thousand-franc notes!" she cried.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mme. Giry, thousand-franc notes! And you knew it!"</p>
<p>"I, sir? I? ... I swear ..."</p>
<p>"Don't swear, Mme. Giry! ... And now I will tell you the second reason why I sent for you. Mme. Giry, I am going to have you arrested."</p>
<p>The two black feathers on the dingy bonnet, which usually affected the attitude of two notes of interrogation, changed into two notes of exclamation; as for the bonnet itself, it swayed in menace on the old lady's tempestuous chignon. Surprise, indignation, protest and dismay were furthermore displayed by little Meg's mother in a sort of extravagant movement of offended virtue, half bound, half slide, that brought her right under the nose of M. Richard, who could not help pushing back his chair.</p>
<p>"HAVE ME ARRESTED!"</p>
<p>The mouth that spoke those words seemed to spit the three teeth that were left to it into Richard's face.</p>
<p>M. Richard behaved like a hero. He retreated no farther. His threatening forefinger seemed already to be pointing out the keeper of Box Five to the absent magistrates.</p>
<p>"I am going to have you arrested, Mme. Giry, as a thief!"</p>
<p>"Say that again!"</p>
<p>And Mme. Giry caught Mr. Manager Richard a mighty box on the ear, before Mr. Manager Moncharmin had time to intervene. But it was not the withered hand of the angry old beldame that fell on the managerial ear, but the envelope itself, the cause of all the trouble, the magic envelope that opened with the blow, scattering the bank-notes, which escaped in a fantastic whirl of giant butterflies.</p>
<p>The two managers gave a shout, and the same thought made them both go on their knees, feverishly, picking up and hurriedly examining the precious scraps of paper.</p>
<p>"Are they still genuine, Moncharmin?"</p>
<p>"Are they still genuine, Richard?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they are still genuine!"</p>
<p>Above their heads, Mme. Giry's three teeth were clashing in a noisy contest, full of hideous interjections. But all that could be clearly distinguished was this LEIT-MOTIF:</p>
<p>"I, a thief! ... I, a thief, I?"</p>
<p>She choked with rage. She shouted:</p>
<p>"I never heard of such a thing!"</p>
<p>And, suddenly, she darted up to Richard again.</p>
<p>"In any case," she yelped, "you, M. Richard, ought to know better than I where the twenty thousand francs went to!"</p>
<p>"I?" asked Richard, astounded. "And how should I know?"</p>
<p>Moncharmin, looking severe and dissatisfied, at once insisted that the good lady should explain herself.</p>
<p>"What does this mean, Mme. Giry?" he asked. "And why do you say that M. Richard ought to know better than you where the twenty-thousand francs went to?"</p>
<p>As for Richard, who felt himself turning red under Moncharmin's eyes, he took Mme. Giry by the wrist and shook it violently. In a voice growling and rolling like thunder, he roared:</p>
<p>"Why should I know better than you where the twenty-thousand francs went to? Why? Answer me!"</p>
<p>"Because they went into your pocket!" gasped the old woman, looking at him as if he were the devil incarnate.</p>
<p>Richard would have rushed upon Mme. Giry, if Moncharmin had not stayed his avenging hand and hastened to ask her, more gently:</p>
<p>"How can you suspect my partner, M. Richard, of putting twenty-thousand francs in his pocket?"</p>
<p>"I never said that," declared Mme. Giry, "seeing that it was myself who put the twenty-thousand francs into M. Richard's pocket." And she added, under her voice, "There! It's out! ... And may the ghost forgive me!"</p>
<p>Richard began bellowing anew, but Moncharmin authoritatively ordered him to be silent.</p>
<p>"Allow me! Allow me! Let the woman explain herself. Let me question her." And he added: "It is really astonishing that you should take up such a tone! ... We are on the verge of clearing up the whole mystery. And you're in a rage! ... You're wrong to behave like that... I'm enjoying myself immensely."</p>
<p>Mme. Giry, like the martyr that she was, raised her head, her face beaming with faith in her own innocence.</p>
<p>"You tell me there were twenty-thousand francs in the envelope which I put into M. Richard's pocket; but I tell you again that I knew nothing about it ... Nor M. Richard either, for that matter!"</p>
<p>"Aha!" said Richard, suddenly assuming a swaggering air which Moncharmin did not like. "I knew nothing either! You put twenty-thousand francs in my pocket and I knew nothing either! I am very glad to hear it, Mme. Giry!"</p>
<p>"Yes," the terrible dame agreed, "yes, it's true. We neither of us knew anything. But you, you must have ended by finding out!"</p>
<p>Richard would certainly have swallowed Mme. Giry alive, if Moncharmin had not been there! But Moncharmin protected her. He resumed his questions:</p>
<p>"What sort of envelope did you put in M. Richard's pocket? It was not the one which we gave you, the one which you took to Box Five before our eyes; and yet that was the one which contained the twenty-thousand francs."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon. The envelope which M. le Directeur gave me was the one which I slipped into M. le Directeur's pocket," explained Mme. Giry. "The one which I took to the ghost's box was another envelope, just like it, which the ghost gave me beforehand and which I hid up my sleeve."</p>
<p>So saying, Mme. Giry took from her sleeve an envelope ready prepared and similarly addressed to that containing the twenty-thousand francs. The managers took it from her. They examined it and saw that it was fastened with seals stamped with their own managerial seal. They opened it. It contained twenty Bank of St. Farce notes like those which had so much astounded them the month before.</p>
<p>"How simple!" said Richard.</p>
<p>"How simple!" repeated Moncharmin. And he continued with his eyes fixed upon Mme. Giry, as though trying to hypnotize her.</p>
<p>"So it was the ghost who gave you this envelope and told you to substitute it for the one which we gave you? And it was the ghost who told you to put the other into M. Richard's pocket?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it was the ghost."</p>
<p>"Then would you mind giving us a specimen of your little talents? Here is the envelope. Act as though we knew nothing."</p>
<p>"As you please, gentlemen."</p>
<p>Mme. Giry took the envelope with the twenty notes inside it and made for the door. She was on the point of going out when the two managers rushed at her:</p>
<p>"Oh, no! Oh, no! We're not going to be 'done' a second time! Once bitten, twice shy!"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen," said the old woman, in self-excuse, "you told me to act as though you knew nothing ... Well, if you knew nothing, I should go away with your envelope!"</p>
<p>"And then how would you slip it into my pocket?" argued Richard, whom Moncharmin fixed with his left eye, while keeping his right on Mme. Giry: a proceeding likely to strain his sight, but Moncharmin was prepared to go to any length to discover the truth.</p>
<p>"I am to slip it into your pocket when you least expect it, sir. You know that I always take a little turn behind the scenes, in the course of the evening, and I often go with my daughter to the ballet-foyer, which I am entitled to do, as her mother; I bring her her shoes, when the ballet is about to begin ... in fact, I come and go as I please ... The subscribers come and go too... So do you, sir ... There are lots of people about ... I go behind you and slip the envelope into the tail-pocket of your dress-coat ... There's no witchcraft about that!"</p>
<p>"No witchcraft!" growled Richard, rolling his eyes like Jupiter Tonans. "No witchcraft! Why, I've just caught you in a lie, you old witch!"</p>
<p>Mme. Giry bristled, with her three teeth sticking out of her mouth.</p>
<p>"And why, may I ask?"</p>
<p>"Because I spent that evening watching Box Five and the sham envelope which you put there. I did not go to the ballet-foyer for a second."</p>
<p>"No, sir, and I did not give you the envelope that evening, but at the next performance ... on the evening when the under-secretary of state for fine arts ..."</p>
<p>At these words, M. Richard suddenly interrupted Mme. Giry:</p>
<p>"Yes, that's true, I remember now! The under-secretary went behind the scenes. He asked for me. I went down to the ballet-foyer for a moment. I was on the foyer steps ... The under-secretary and his chief clerk were in the foyer itself. I suddenly turned around ... you had passed behind me, Mme. Giry ... You seemed to push against me ... Oh, I can see you still, I can see you still!"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's it, sir, that's it. I had just finished my little business. That pocket of yours, sir, is very handy!"</p>
<p>And Mme. Giry once more suited the action to the word, She passed behind M. Richard and, so nimbly that Moncharmin himself was impressed by it, slipped the envelope into the pocket of one of the tails of M. Richard's dress-coat.</p>
<p>"Of course!" exclaimed Richard, looking a little pale. "It's very clever of O. G. The problem which he had to solve was this: how to do away with any dangerous intermediary between the man who gives the twenty-thousand francs and the man who receives it. And by far the best thing he could hit upon was to come and take the money from my pocket without my noticing it, as I myself did not know that it was there. It's wonderful!"</p>
<p>"Oh, wonderful, no doubt!" Moncharmin agreed. "Only, you forget, Richard, that I provided ten-thousand francs of the twenty and that nobody put anything in my pocket!"</p>

<h3 class="c2" id="pgepubid00023">Chapter XVII The Safety-Pin Again</h3>
<p>Moncharmin's last phrase so dearly expressed the suspicion in which he now held his partner that it was bound to cause a stormy explanation, at the end of which it was agreed that Richard should yield to all Moncharmin's wishes, with the object of helping him to discover the miscreant who was victimizing them.</p>
<p>This brings us to the interval after the Garden Act, with the strange conduct observed by M. Remy and those curious lapses from the dignity that might be expected of the managers. It was arranged between Richard and Moncharmin, first, that Richard should repeat the exact movements which he had made on the night of the disappearance of the first twenty-thousand francs; and, second, that Moncharmin should not for an instant lose sight of Richard's coat-tail pocket, into which Mme. Giry was to slip the twenty-thousand francs.</p>
<p>M. Richard went and placed himself at the identical spot where he had stood when he bowed to the under-secretary for fine arts. M. Moncharmin took up his position a few steps behind him.</p>
<p>Mme. Giry passed, rubbed up against M. Richard, got rid of her twenty-thousand francs in the manager's coat-tail pocket and disappeared ... Or rather she was conjured away. In accordance with the instructions received from Moncharmin a few minutes earlier, Mercier took the good lady to the acting-manager's office and turned the key on her, thus making it impossible for her to communicate with her ghost.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, M. Richard was bending and bowing and scraping and walking backward, just as if he had that high and mighty minister, the under-secretary for fine arts, before him. Only, though these marks of politeness would have created no astonishment if the under-secretary of state had really been in front of M. Richard, they caused an easily comprehensible amazement to the spectators of this very natural but quite inexplicable scene when M. Richard had no body in front of him.</p>
<p>M. Richard bowed ... to nobody; bent his back ... before nobody; and walked backward ... before nobody ... And, a few steps behind him, M. Moncharmin did the same thing that he was doing in addition to pushing away M. Remy and begging M. de La Borderie, the ambassador, and the manager of the Credit Central "not to touch M. le Directeur."</p>
<p>Moncharmin, who had his own ideas, did not want Richard to come to him presently, when the twenty-thousand francs were gone, and say:</p>
<p>"Perhaps it was the ambassador ... or the manager of the Credit Central ... or Remy."</p>
<p>The more so as, at the time of the first scene, as Richard himself admitted, Richard had met nobody in that part of the theater after Mme. Giry had brushed up against him...</p>
<p>Having begun by walking backward in order to bow, Richard continued to do so from prudence, until he reached the passage leading to the offices of the management. In this way, he was constantly watched by Moncharmin from behind and himself kept an eye on any one approaching from the front. Once more, this novel method of walking behind the scenes, adopted by the managers of our National Academy of Music, attracted attention; but the managers themselves thought of nothing but their twenty-thousand francs.</p>
<p>On reaching the half-dark passage, Richard said to Moncharmin, in a low voice:</p>
<p>"I am sure that nobody has touched me ... You had now better keep at some distance from me and watch me till I come to door of the office: it is better not to arouse suspicion and we can see anything that happens."</p>
<p>But Moncharmin replied. "No, Richard, no! You walk ahead and I'll walk immediately behind you! I won't leave you by a step!"</p>
<p>"But, in that case," exclaimed Richard, "they will never steal our twenty-thousand francs!"</p>
<p>"I should hope not, indeed!" declared Moncharmin.</p>
<p>"Then what we are doing is absurd!"</p>
<p>"We are doing exactly what we did last time ... Last time, I joined you as you were leaving the stage and followed close behind you down this passage."</p>
<p>"That's true!" sighed Richard, shaking his head and passively obeying Moncharmin.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, the joint managers locked themselves into their office. Moncharmin himself put the key in his pocket:</p>
<p>"We remained locked up like this, last time," he said, "until you left the Opera to go home."</p>
<p>"That's so. No one came and disturbed us, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"No one."</p>
<p>"Then," said Richard, who was trying to collect his memory, "then I must certainly have been robbed on my way home from the Opera."</p>
<p>"No," said Moncharmin in a drier tone than ever, "no, that's impossible. For I dropped you in my cab. The twenty-thousand francs disappeared at your place: there's not a shadow of a doubt about that."</p>
<p>"It's incredible!" protested Richard. "I am sure of my servants ... and if one of them had done it, he would have disappeared since."</p>
<p>Moncharmin shrugged his shoulders, as though to say that he did not wish to enter into details, and Richard began to think that Moncharmin was treating him in a very insupportable fashion.</p>
<p>"Moncharmin, I've had enough of this!"</p>
<p>"Richard, I've had too much of it!"</p>
<p>"Do you dare to suspect me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of a silly joke."</p>
<p>"One doesn't joke with twenty-thousand francs."</p>
<p>"That's what I think," declared Moncharmin, unfolding a newspaper and ostentatiously studying its contents.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" asked Richard. "Are you going to read the paper next?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Richard, until I take you home."</p>
<p>"Like last time?"</p>
<p>"Yes, like last time."</p>
<p>Richard snatched the paper from Moncharmin's hands. Moncharmin stood up, more irritated than ever, and found himself faced by an exasperated Richard, who, crossing his arms on his chest, said:</p>
<p>"Look here, I'm thinking of this, I'M THINKING OF WHAT I MIGHT THINK if, like last time, after my spending the evening alone with you, you brought me home and if, at the moment of parting, I perceived that twenty-thousand francs had disappeared from my coat-pocket ... like last time."</p>
<p>"And what might you think?" asked Moncharmin, crimson with rage.</p>
<p>"I might think that, as you hadn't left me by a foot's breadth and as, by your own wish, you were the only one to approach me, like last time, I might think that, if that twenty-thousand francs was no longer in my pocket, it stood a very good chance of being in yours!"</p>
<p>Moncharmin leaped up at the suggestion.</p>
<p>"Oh!" he shouted. "A safety-pin!"</p>
<p>"What do you want a safety-pin for?"</p>
<p>"To fasten you up with! ... A safety-pin! ... A safety-pin!"</p>
<p>"You want to fasten me with a safety-pin?"</p>
<p>"Yes, to fasten you to the twenty-thousand francs! Then, whether it's here, or on the drive from here to your place, or at your place, you will feel the hand that pulls at your pocket and you will see if it's mine! Oh, so you're suspecting me now, are you? A safety-pin!"</p>
<p>And that was the moment when Moncharmin opened the door on the passage and shouted:</p>
<p>"A safety-pin! ... somebody give me a safety-pin!"</p>
<p>And we also know how, at the same moment, Remy, who had no safety-pin, was received by Moncharmin, while a boy procured the pin so eagerly longed for. And what happened was this: Moncharmin first locked the door again. Then he knelt down behind Richard's back.</p>
<p>"I hope," he said, "that the notes are still there?"</p>
<p>"So do I," said Richard.</p>
<p>"The real ones?" asked Moncharmin, resolved not to be "had" this time.</p>
<p>"Look for yourself," said Richard. "I refuse to touch them."</p>
<p>Moncharmin took the envelope from Richard's pocket and drew out the bank-notes with a trembling hand, for, this time, in order frequently to make sure of the presence of the notes, he had not sealed the envelope nor even fastened it. He felt reassured on finding that they were all there and quite genuine. He put them back in the tail-pocket and pinned them with great care. Then he sat down behind Richard's coat-tails and kept his eyes fixed on them, while Richard, sitting at his writing-table, did not stir.</p>
<p>"A little patience, Richard," said Moncharmin. "We have only a few minutes to wait ... The clock will soon strike twelve. Last time, we left at the last stroke of twelve."</p>
<p>"Oh, I shall have all the patience necessary!"</p>
<p>The time passed, slow, heavy, mysterious, stifling. Richard tried to laugh.</p>
<p>"I shall end by believing in the omnipotence of the ghost," he said. "Just now, don't you find something uncomfortable, disquieting, alarming in the atmosphere of this room?"</p>
<p>"You're quite right," said Moncharmin, who was really impressed.</p>
<p>"The ghost!" continued Richard, in a low voice, as though fearing lest he should be overheard by invisible ears. "The ghost! Suppose, all the same, it were a ghost who puts the magic envelopes on the table ... who talks in Box Five ... who killed Joseph Buquet ... who unhooked the chandelier ... and who robs us! For, after all, after all, after all, there is no one here except you and me, and, if the notes disappear and neither you nor I have anything to do with it, well, we shall have to believe in the ghost ... in the ghost."</p>
<p>At that moment, the clock on the mantlepiece gave its warning click and the first stroke of twelve struck.</p>
<p>The two managers shuddered. The perspiration streamed from their foreheads. The twelfth stroke sounded strangely in their ears.</p>
<p>When the clock stopped, they gave a sigh and rose from their chairs.</p>
<p>"I think we can go now," said Moncharmin.</p>
<p>"I think so," Richard a agreed.</p>
<p>"Before we go, do you mind if I look in your pocket?"</p>
<p>"But, of course, Moncharmin, YOU MUST! ... Well?" he asked, as Moncharmin was feeling at the pocket.</p>
<p>"Well, I can feel the pin."</p>
<p>"Of course, as you said, we can't be robbed without noticing it."</p>
<p>But Moncharmin, whose hands were still fumbling, bellowed:</p>
<p>"I can feel the pin, but I can't feel the notes!"</p>
<p>"Come, no joking, Moncharmin! ... This isn't the time for it."</p>
<p>"Well, feel for yourself."</p>
<p>Richard tore off his coat. The two managers turned the pocket inside out. THE POCKET WAS EMPTY. And the curious thing was that the pin remained, stuck in the same place.</p>
<p>Richard and Moncharmin turned pale. There was no longer any doubt about the witchcraft.</p>
<p>"The ghost!" muttered Moncharmin.</p>
<p>But Richard suddenly sprang upon his partner.</p>
<p>"No one but you has touched my pocket! Give me back my twenty-thousand francs! ... Give me back my twenty-thousand francs! ..."</p>
<p>"On my soul," sighed Moncharmin, who was ready to swoon, "on my soul, I swear that I haven't got it!"</p>
<p>Then somebody knocked at the door. Moncharmin opened it automatically, seemed hardly to recognize Mercier, his business-manager, exchanged a few words with him, without knowing what he was saying and, with an unconscious movement, put the safety-pin, for which he had no further use, into the hands of his bewildered subordinate ...</p>

<h3 class="c2" id="pgepubid00024">Chapter XVIII The Commissary, The Viscount and the Persian</h3>
<p>The first words of the commissary of police, on entering the managers' office, were to ask after the missing prima donna.</p>
<p>"Is Christine Daae here?"</p>
<p>"Christine Daae here?" echoed Richard. "No. Why?"</p>
<p>As for Moncharmin, he had not the strength left to utter a word.</p>
<p>Richard repeated, for the commissary and the compact crowd which had followed him into the office observed an impressive silence.</p>
<p>"Why do you ask if Christine Daae is here, M. LE COMMISSAIRE?"</p>
<p>"Because she has to be found," declared the commissary of police solemnly.</p>
<p>"What do you mean, she has to be found? Has she disappeared?"</p>
<p>"In the middle of the performance!"</p>
<p>"In the middle of the performance? This is extraordinary!"</p>
<p>"Isn't it? And what is quite as extraordinary is that you should first learn it from me!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Richard, taking his head in his hands and muttering. "What is this new business? Oh, it's enough to make a man send in his resignation!"</p>
<p>And he pulled a few hairs out of his mustache without even knowing what he was doing.</p>
<p>"So she ... so she disappeared in the middle of the performance?" he repeated.</p>
<p>"Yes, she was carried off in the Prison Act, at the moment when she was invoking the aid of the angels; but I doubt if she was carried off by an angel."</p>
<p>"And I am sure that she was!"</p>
<p>Everybody looked round. A young man, pale and trembling with excitement, repeated:</p>
<p>"I am sure of it!"</p>
<p>"Sure of what?" asked Mifroid.</p>
<p>"That Christine Daae was carried off by an angel, M. LE COMMISSAIRE and I can tell you his name."</p>
<p>"Aha, M. le Vicomte de Chagny! So you maintain that Christine Daae was carried off by an angel: an angel of the Opera, no doubt?"</p>
<p>"Yes, monsieur, by an angel of the Opera; and I will tell you where he lives ... when we are alone."</p>
<p>"You are right, monsieur."</p>
<p>And the commissary of police, inviting Raoul to take a chair, cleared the room of all the rest, excepting the managers.</p>
<p>Then Raoul spoke:</p>
<p>"M. le Commissaire, the angel is called Erik, he lives in the Opera and he is the Angel of Music!"</p>
<p>"The Angel of Music! Really! That is very curious! ... The Angel of Music!" And, turning to the managers, M. Mifroid asked, "Have you an Angel of Music on the premises, gentlemen?"</p>
<p>Richard and Moncharmin shook their heads, without even speaking.</p>
<p>"Oh," said the viscount, "those gentlemen have heard of the Opera ghost. Well, I am in a position to state that the Opera ghost and the Angel of Music are one and the same person; and his real name is Erik."</p>
<p>M. Mifroid rose and looked at Raoul attentively.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, monsieur but is it your intention to make fun of the law? And, if not, what is all this about the Opera ghost?"</p>
<p>"I say that these gentlemen have heard of him."</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, it appears that you know the Opera ghost?"</p>
<p>Richard rose, with the remaining hairs of his mustache in his hand.</p>
<p>"No, M. Commissary, no, we do not know him, but we wish that we did, for this very evening he has robbed us of twenty-thousand francs!"</p>
<p>And Richard turned a terrible look on Moncharmin, which seemed to say:</p>
<p>"Give me back the twenty-thousand francs, or I'll tell the whole story."</p>
<p>Moncharmin understood what he meant, for, with a distracted gesture, he said:</p>
<p>"Oh, tell everything and have done with it!"</p>
<p>As for Mifroid, he looked at the managers and at Raoul by turns and wondered whether he had strayed into a lunatic asylum. He passed his hand through his hair.</p>
<p>"A ghost," he said, "who, on the same evening, carries off an opera-singer and steals twenty-thousand francs is a ghost who must have his hands very full! If you don't mind, we will take the questions in order. The singer first, the twenty-thousand francs after. Come, M. de Chagny, let us try to talk seriously. You believe that Mlle. Christine Daae has been carried off by an individual called Erik. Do you know this person? Have you seen him?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"In a church yard."</p>
<p>M. Mifroid gave a start, began to scrutinize Raoul again and said:</p>
<p>"Of course! ... That's where ghosts usually hang out! ... And what were you doing in that churchyard?"</p>
<p>"Monsieur," said Raoul, "I can quite understand how absurd my replies must seem to you. But I beg you to believe that I am in full possession of my faculties. The safety of the person dearest to me in the world is at stake. I should like to convince you in a few words, for time is pressing and every minute is valuable. Unfortunately, if I do not tell you the strangest story that ever was from the beginning, you will not believe me. I will tell you all I know about the Opera ghost, M. Commissary. Alas, I do not know much! ..."</p>
<p>"Never mind, go on, go on!" exclaimed Richard and Moncharmin, suddenly greatly interested.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for their hopes of learning some detail that could put them on the track of their hoaxer, they were soon compelled to accept the fact that M. Raoul de Chagny had completely lost his head. All that story about Perros-Guirec, death's heads and enchanted violins, could only have taken birth in the disordered brain of a youth mad with love. It was evident, also, that Mr. Commissary Mifroid shared their view; and the magistrate would certainly have cut short the incoherent narrative if circumstances had not taken it upon themselves to interrupt it.</p>
<p>The door opened and a man entered, curiously dressed in an enormous frock-coat and a tall hat, at once shabby and shiny, that came down to his ears. He went up to the commissary and spoke to him in a whisper. It was doubtless a detective come to deliver an important communication.</p>
<p>During this conversation, M. Mifroid did not take his eyes off Raoul. At last, addressing him, he said:</p>
<p>"Monsieur, we have talked enough about the ghost. We will now talk about yourself a little, if you have no objection: you were to carry off Mlle. Christine Daae to-night?"</p>
<p>"Yes, M. le Commissaire."</p>
<p>"After the performance?"</p>
<p>"Yes, M. le Commissaire."</p>
<p>"All your arrangements were made?"</p>
<p>"Yes, M. le Commissaire."</p>
<p>"The carriage that brought you was to take you both away... There were fresh horses in readiness at every stage ..."</p>
<p>"That is true, M. le Commissaire."</p>
<p>"And nevertheless your carriage is still outside the Rotunda awaiting your orders, is it not?"</p>
<p>"Yes, M. le Commissaire."</p>
<p>"Did you know that there were three other carriages there, in addition to yours?"</p>
<p>"I did not pay the least attention."</p>
<p>"They were the carriages of Mlle. Sorelli, which could not find room in the Cour de l'Administration; of Carlotta; and of your brother, M. le Comte de Chagny..."</p>
<p>"Very likely..."</p>
<p>"What is certain is that, though your carriage and Sorelli's and Carlotta's are still there, by the Rotunda pavement, M. le Comte de Chagny's carriage is gone."</p>
<p>"This has nothing to say to ..."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon. Was not M. le Comte opposed to your marriage with Mlle. Daae?"</p>
<p>"That is a matter that only concerns the family."</p>
<p>"You have answered my question: he was opposed to it ... and that was why you were carrying Christine Daae out of your brother's reach... Well, M. de Chagny, allow me to inform you that your brother has been smarter than you! It is he who has carried off Christine Daae!"</p>
<p>"Oh, impossible!" moaned Raoul, pressing his hand to his heart. "Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Immediately after the artist's disappearance, which was procured by means which we have still to ascertain, he flung into his carriage, which drove right across Paris at a furious pace."</p>
<p>"Across Paris?" asked poor Raoul, in a hoarse voice. "What do you mean by across Paris?"</p>
<p>"Across Paris and out of Paris ... by the Brussels road."</p>
<p>"Oh," cried the young man, "I shall catch them!" And he rushed out of the office.</p>
<p>"And bring her back to us!" cried the commisary gaily ... "Ah, that's a trick worth two of the Angel of Music's!"</p>
<p>And, turning to his audience, M. Mifroid delivered a little lecture on police methods.</p>
<p>"I don't know for a moment whether M. le Comte de Chagny has really carried Christine Daae off or not ... but I want to know and I believe that, at this moment, no one is more anxious to inform us than his brother ... And now he is flying in pursuit of him! He is my chief auxiliary! This, gentlemen, is the art of the police, which is believed to be so complicated and which, nevertheless appears so simple as soon its you see that it consists in getting your work done by people who have nothing to do with the police."</p>
<p>But M. le Commissaire de Police Mifroid would not have been quite so satisfied with himself if he had known that the rush of his rapid emissary was stopped at the entrance to the very first corridor. A tall figure blocked Raoul's way.</p>
<p>"Where are you going so fast, M. de Chagny?" asked a voice.</p>
<p>Raoul impatiently raised his eyes and recognized the astrakhan cap of an hour ago. He stopped:</p>
<p>"It's you!" he cried, in a feverish voice. "You, who know Erik's secrets and don't want me to speak of them. Who are you?"</p>
<p>"You know who I am! ... I am the Persian!"</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a id="chap19"/></p>
<h3 class="c2" id="pgepubid00025">Chapter XIX The Viscount and the Persian</h3>
<p>Raoul now remembered that his brother had once shown him that mysterious person, of whom nothing was known except that he was a Persian and that he lived in a little old-fashioned flat in the Rue de Rivoli.</p>
<p>The man with the ebony skin, the eyes of jade and the astrakhan cap bent over Raoul.</p>
<p>"I hope, M. de Chagny," he said, "that you have not betrayed Erik's secret?"</p>
<p>"And why should I hesitate to betray that monster, sir?" Raoul rejoined haughtily, trying to shake off the intruder. "Is he your friend, by any chance?"</p>
<p>"I hope that you said nothing about Erik, sir, because Erik's secret is also Christine Daae's and to talk about one is to talk about the other!"</p>
<p>"Oh, sir," said Raoul, becoming more and more impatient, "you seem to know about many things that interest me; and yet I have no time to listen to you!"</p>
<p>"Once more, M. de Chagny, where are you going so fast?"</p>
<p>"Can not you guess? To Christine Daae's assistance..."</p>
<p>"Then, sir, stay here, for Christine Daae is here!"</p>
<p>"With Erik?"</p>
<p>"With Erik."</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"I was at the performance and no one in the world but Erik could contrive an abduction like that! ... Oh," he said, with a deep sigh, "I recognized the monster's touch! ..."</p>
<p>"You know him then?"</p>
<p>The Persian did not reply, but heaved a fresh sigh.</p>
<p>"Sir," said Raoul, "I do not know what your intentions are, but can you do anything to help me? I mean, to help Christine Daae?"</p>
<p>"I think so, M. de Chagny, and that is why I spoke to you."</p>
<p>"What can you do?"</p>
<p>"Try to take you to her ... and to him."</p>
<p>"If you can do me that service, sir, my life is yours! ... One word more: the commissary of police tells me that Christine Daae has been carried off by my brother, Count Philippe."</p>
<p>"Oh, M. de Chagny, I don't believe a word of it."</p>
<p>"It's not possible, is it?"</p>
<p>"I don't know if it is possible or not; but there are ways and ways of carrying people off; and M. le Comte Philippe has never, as far as I know, had anything to do with witchcraft."</p>
<p>"Your arguments are convincing, sir, and I am a fool! ... Oh, let us make haste! I place myself entirely in your hands! ... How should I not believe you, when you are the only one to believe me ... when you are the only one not to smile when Erik's name is mentioned?"</p>
<p>And the young man impetuously seized the Persian's hands. They were ice-cold.</p>
<p>"Silence!" said the Persian, stopping and listening to the distant sounds of the theater. "We must not mention that name here. Let us say 'he' and 'him;' then there will be less danger of attracting his attention."</p>
<p>"Do you think he is near us?"</p>
<p>"It is quite possible, Sir, if he is not, at this moment, with his victim, IN THE HOUSE ON THE LAKE."</p>
<p>"Ah, so you know that house too?"</p>
<p>"If he is not there, he may be here, in this wall, in this floor, in this ceiling! ... Come!"</p>
<p>And the Persian, asking Raoul to deaden the sound of his footsteps, led him down passages which Raoul had never seen before, even at the time when Christine used to take him for walks through that labyrinth.</p>
<p>"If only Darius has come!" said the Persian.</p>
<p>"Who is Darius?"</p>
<p>"Darius? My servant."</p>
<p>They were now in the center of a real deserted square, an immense apartment ill-lit by a small lamp. The Persian stopped Raoul and, in the softest of whispers, asked:</p>
<p>"What did you say to the commissary?"</p>
<p>"I said that Christine Daae's abductor was the Angel of Music, ALIAS the Opera ghost, and that the real name was ..."</p>
<p>"Hush! ... And did he believe you?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"He attached no importance to what you said?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"He took you for a bit of a madman?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"So much the better!" sighed the Persian.</p>
<p>And they continued their road. After going up and down several staircases which Raoul had never seen before, the two men found themselves in front of a door which the Persian opened with a master-key. The Persian and Raoul were both, of course, in dress-clothes; but, whereas Raoul had a tall hat, the Persian wore the astrakhan cap which I have already mentioned. It was an infringement of the rule which insists upon the tall hat behind the scenes; but in France foreigners are allowed every license: the Englishman his traveling-cap, the Persian his cap of astrakhan.</p>
<p>"Sir," said the Persian, "your tall hat will be in your way: you would do well to leave it in the dressing-room."</p>
<p>"What dressing-room?" asked Raoul.</p>
<p>"Christine Daae's."</p>
<p>And the Persian, letting Raoul through the door which he had just opened, showed him the actress' room opposite. They were at the end of the passage the whole length of which Raoul had been accustomed to traverse before knocking at Christine's door.</p>
<p>"How well you know the Opera, sir!"</p>
<p>"Not so well as 'he' does!" said the Persian modestly.</p>
<p>And he pushed the young man into Christine's dressing-room, which was as Raoul had left it a few minutes earlier.</p>
<p>Closing the door, the Persian went to a very thin partition that separated the dressing-room from a big lumber-room next to it. He listened and then coughed loudly.</p>
<p>There was a sound of some one stirring in the lumber-room; and, a few seconds later, a finger tapped at the door.</p>
<p>"Come in," said the Persian.</p>
<p>A man entered, also wearing an astrakhan cap and dressed in a long overcoat. He bowed and took a richly carved case from under his coat, put it on the dressing-table, bowed once again and went to the door.</p>
<p>"Did no one see you come in, Darius?"</p>
<p>"No, master."</p>
<p>"Let no one see you go out."</p>
<p>The servant glanced down the passage and swiftly disappeared.</p>
<p>The Persian opened the case. It contained a pair of long pistols.</p>
<p>"When Christine Daae was carried off, sir, I sent word to my servant to bring me these pistols. I have had them a long time and they can be relied upon."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to fight a duel?" asked the young man.</p>
<p>"It will certainly be a duel which we shall have to fight," said the other, examining the priming of his pistols. "And what a duel!" Handing one of the pistols to Raoul, he added, "In this duel, we shall be two to one; but you must be prepared for everything, for we shall be fighting the most terrible adversary that you can imagine. But you love Christine Daae, do you not?"</p>
<p>"I worship the ground she stands on! But you, sir, who do not love her, tell me why I find you ready to risk your life for her! You must certainly hate Erik!"</p>
<p>"No, sir," said the Persian sadly, "I do not hate him. If I hated him, he would long ago have ceased doing harm."</p>
<p>"Has he done you harm?"</p>
<p>"I have forgiven him the harm which he has done me."</p>
<p>"I do not understand you. You treat him as a monster, you speak of his crime, he has done you harm and I find in you the same inexplicable pity that drove me to despair when I saw it in Christine!"</p>
<p>The Persian did not reply. He fetched a stool and set it against the wall facing the great mirror that filled the whole of the wall-space opposite. Then he climbed on the stool and, with his nose to the wallpaper, seemed to be looking for something.</p>
<p>"Ah," he said, after a long search, "I have it!" And, raising his finger above his head, he pressed against a corner in the pattern of the paper. Then he turned round and jumped off the stool:</p>
<p>"In half a minute," he said, "he shall be ON HIS ROAD!" and crossing the whole of the dressing-room he felt the great mirror.</p>
<p>"No, it is not yielding yet," he muttered.</p>
<p>"Oh, are we going out by the mirror?" asked Raoul. "Like Christine Daae."</p>
<p>"So you knew that Christine Daae went out by that mirror?"</p>
<p>"She did so before my eyes, sir! I was hidden behind the curtain of the inner room and I saw her vanish not by the glass, but in the glass!"</p>
<p>"And what did you do?"</p>
<p>"I thought it was an aberration of my senses, a mad dream.</p>
<p>"Or some new fancy of the ghost's!" chuckled the Persian. "Ah, M. de Chagny," he continued, still with his hand on the mirror, "would that we had to do with a ghost! We could then leave our pistols in their case ... Put down your hat, please ... there ... and now cover your shirt-front as much as you can with your coat ... as I am doing ... Bring the lapels forward ... turn up the collar ... We must make ourselves as invisible as possible."</p>
<p>Bearing against the mirror, after a short silence, he said:</p>
<p>"It takes some time to release the counterbalance, when you press on the spring from the inside of the room. It is different when you are behind the wall and can act directly on the counterbalance. Then the mirror turns at once and is moved with incredible rapidity."</p>
<p>"What counterbalance?" asked Raoul.</p>
<p>"Why, the counterbalance that lifts the whole of this wall on to its pivot. You surely don't expect it to move of itself, by enchantment! If you watch, you will see the mirror first rise an inch or two and then shift an inch or two from left to right. It will then be on a pivot and will swing round."</p>
<p>"It's not turning!" said Raoul impatiently.</p>
<p>"Oh, wait! You have time enough to be impatient, sir! The mechanism has obviously become rusty, or else the spring isn't working... Unless it is something else," added the Persian, anxiously.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"He may simply have cut the cord of the counterbalance and blocked the whole apparatus."</p>
<p>"Why should he? He does not know that we are coming this way!"</p>
<p>"I dare say he suspects it, for he knows that I understand the system."</p>
<p>"It's not turning! ... And Christine, sir, Christine?"</p>
<p>The Persian said coldly:</p>
<p>"We shall do all that it is humanly possible to do! ... But he may stop us at the first step! ... He commands the walls, the doors and the trapdoors. In my country, he was known by a name which means the 'trap-door lover.'"</p>
<p>"But why do these walls obey him alone? He did not build them!"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, that is just what he did!"</p>
<p>Raoul looked at him in amazement; but the Persian made a sign to him to be silent and pointed to the glass ... There was a sort of shivering reflection. Their image was troubled as in a rippling sheet of water and then all became stationary again.</p>
<p>"You see, sir, that it is not turning! Let us take another road!"</p>
<p>"To-night, there is no other!" declared the Persian, in a singularly mournful voice. "And now, look out! And be ready to fire."</p>
<p>He himself raised his pistol opposite the glass. Raoul imitated his movement. With his free arm, the Persian drew the young man to his chest and, suddenly, the mirror turned, in a blinding daze of cross-lights: it turned like one of those revolving doors which have lately been fixed to the entrances of most restaurants, it turned, carrying Raoul and the Persian with it and suddenly hurling them from the full light into the deepest darkness.</p>
